# Reversi-Pro-Endless
Reversi, also known as reversal chess, is popular. This time we bring you Chinese reversal chess!


When your chess piece surrounds your opponent's chess piece in a straight line, you can flip the color of the pieces to make them yours. All linear directions are valid: horizontal, vertical and oblique directions.

Only the pieces that surround and flip the opponent can be taken. Each turn must flip at least one opponent's piece.
